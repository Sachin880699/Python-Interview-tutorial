# How do you design a Django application to handle high traffic and scale efficiently?

To handle high traffic, I use caching (Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load, optimize database queries with indexing, and use database replicas for read-heavy workloads. I also deploy load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers and use asynchronous tasks with Celery to handle background jobs. Additionally, I serve static and media files via CDN to reduce server load.

# What caching strategies have you implemented in Django?

I have used Django’s cache framework with Redis as the backend. I cache frequently accessed data like querysets and template fragments. For example, I use per-view caching for pages that don’t change often, and low-level caching for expensive database queries. Cache invalidation is handled carefully to ensure data consistency.

# How do you optimize database performance in large-scale Django apps?

I use database indexing on frequently filtered columns, optimize queries using Django’s select_related and prefetch_related to reduce joins, and avoid N+1 query problems. For heavy read operations, I implement read replicas. For extremely large datasets, I consider database sharding or partitioning.

# What security measures do you take in a large Django project?

I enforce HTTPS using SSL certificates, enable Django’s built-in CSRF protection, use Django’s authentication and permission frameworks, sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks, and keep Django and dependencies updated. I also use tools like Django Security Middleware and configure secure cookies.

# How do you structure your Django project for maintainability?

I organize the project into multiple small, modular apps focused on specific functionalities. I follow the DRY principle, use reusable components, and keep business logic separate from views and templates. I also document the code and maintain consistent coding standards.

# How do you monitor and log a production Django app?

I use centralized logging solutions like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Sentry for error tracking. For performance monitoring, I use tools like New Relic or Datadog. Alerts are configured to notify the team of critical issues immediately.

# How do you handle API versioning in Django REST Framework?

I implement versioning using URL path versioning (e.g., /api/v1/), header versioning, or query parameter versioning. This allows multiple API versions to coexist, providing backward compatibility. I document changes clearly and deprecate old versions gradually.

# What is the role of WSGI and ASGI in Django? When would you use each?
WSGI is the traditional interface for synchronous web apps, suitable for most Django apps. ASGI is the newer standard supporting asynchronous capabilities like WebSockets and long-polling. I use ASGI (with uvicorn or daphne) when implementing Django Channels or async views to improve concurrency.

# How do you ensure API performance in Django REST Framework (DRF)?
I use pagination, selective field serialization with SerializerMethodField, and avoid N+1 queries using select_related and prefetch_related. For large responses, I use gzip compression. I also cache expensive API responses and use throttling to prevent abuse.

# What are the best practices for securing a Django application in production?

Set DEBUG = False

Use ALLOWED_HOSTS properly

Secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

Enforce HTTPS and HSTS

Regularly update dependencies

Use Django security middleware

Sanitize all user inputs

Monitor vulnerabilities using tools like Bandit or Snyk
