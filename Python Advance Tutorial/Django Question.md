# what is a django

Django is a Python-based web application framework that is free and open source. A framework is simply a collection of modules that facilitate development.
They're grouped together and allow you to build apps or websites from scratch rather than starting from scratch.

# Explain the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and how it differs from the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture used in Django.

**Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:**

**Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for managing the data,
the rules for updating or processing that data, and notifying the View when changes occur.

**View:** Represents the user interface and presentation layer. It displays the data to the user and sends user input to the Controller.
The View is passive and doesn't directly interact with the Model; instead, 
it receives updates from the Model through the Controller.

**Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it (possibly updating the Model),
and updates the View accordingly. 
The Controller manages the flow of information between the Model and the View.


**Model-View-Template (MVT) Architecture (Django's interpretation):**

**Model:** Similar to MVC, the Model in Django represents the application's data and business logic. It defines the structure of the database,
including tables and relationships, and provides an abstraction layer for database operations.

**View:** In Django's MVT, the View is responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the Model to retrieve or update data, and rendering the appropriate template.
The template, in this case, is what corresponds to the traditional View in MVC.

**Template:** Django introduces the concept of a Template, which is responsible for defining the structure of the HTML pages. 
It represents the presentation layer and is similar to the traditional View in MVC. The Template receives data from the View and renders it into HTML,
handling how the information is displayed.
