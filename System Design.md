# what is latency

latency mhanje **Network delay** and **computational delay** <br>

 Latency refers to the delay that happens between when a user takes an action on a network or web application and when it reaches its destination,<br>
 which is measured in milliseconds

# Reducing latency

1 ) use cacheing layer add karu shakto <br>
2 ) use CDN (content delivery network )  :- ya madhe kay karto suppose mi request karto india madhe but data yayla vel lagel <br>
tar mi kay karto data ha javalchya server var thevto example mumbai location la

CDN geographically located astat 

# caching
caching is the process of storing information for a set period of time on a computer
ya madhe jya server la mi data sathi request send karto tyach server var data cache madhe stored asto


# Throughput

The valume of work or information flowing through a system <br>

**Defination**

Throughput is the amount of data transmitted per unit of time. It is the process flow rate. Throughput is measured in bites per second i.e bps
